Simple ec2 tools that can be used to better star/stop/create instances on ec2.

Currently these are the available tools:

* ec2-api.py

Can be used to issue different ec2 webservice API calls found 
here:http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/index.html?ApiReference-soap-CreateSecurityGroup.html
and you can easily use it to basicaly generate the exact HTTP url to hit when
trying to execute any of those requests using your AWS Key ID and AWS Secret Key.

Here are a few examples:

./ec2-api.py --host=ec2.amazonaws.com --key=YOUR_KEY --secret=YOUR_SECRET DescribeRegions
GET https://ec2.amazonaws.com/?AWSAccessKeyId=YOUR_KEY&Action=DescribeRegions&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2011-01-01&Version=2010-06-15&Signature=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

You can then simply issue a curl https://xxx, where XXX is the previously 
printed URL and now you can have a simple link click or even have GitHub do a 
POST url check
